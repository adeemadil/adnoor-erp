## Development Workflow

### Local Development
1. **Setup**: Use easy install script for development environment
2. **Development**: Make changes in adnoor_custom app
3. **Testing**: Test all changes locally
4. **Version Control**: Commit changes to git
5. **Deployment**: Deploy to production when ready

### Production Deployment
1. **Preparation**: Ensure all changes are tested locally
2. **Deployment**: Use deployment scripts for Contabo VM
3. **Validation**: Verify deployment success
4. **Monitoring**: Monitor system performance
5. **Backup**: Ensure backups are working

## Technical Architecture

### Development Environment
- **Framework**: Frappe Framework
- **Database**: MariaDB
- **Cache**: Redis
- **Web Server**: Nginx
- **Setup**: Docker containers via easy install script

### Production Environment
- **Server**: Contabo VM
- **Domain**: adnoorerp.com
- **SSL**: Let's Encrypt (automatic)
- **Backup**: Automated daily backups
- **Monitoring**: System monitoring and alerts

## Key Principles

1. **All customizations in adnoor_custom app**
   - Custom fields
   - Custom forms
   - Custom reports
   - Custom workflows

2. **Version control for all changes**
   - Export fixtures for customizations
   - Track all code changes
   - Maintain deployment history

3. **Test locally before production**
   - Full testing in development environment
   - Validate all business processes
   - Performance testing

4. **Mirror production data structure**
   - Keep development and production in sync
   - Regular data synchronization
   - Consistent configuration

5. **Proper git workflow**
   - Feature branches for development
   - Code reviews before merging
   - Tagged releases for production

## Common Commands

### Development
```bash
# Start development environment
./scripts/start-dev.sh

# Create custom app
bench new-app --no-git adnoor_custom

# Install custom app
bench --site sitename install-app adnoor_custom

# Export fixtures
bench --site sitename export-fixtures

# Build assets
bench build
```

### Production
```bash
# Deploy to production
./scripts/deploy-production.sh

# Backup site
bench --site sitename backup --with-files

# Restore backup
bench --site sitename restore /path/to/backup
```

## Risk Management

scp user@your-contabo-server:/path/to/backups/*.tar.gz /Users/adeemadilkhatri/adnoor-erp/backups/
```

### Restore Process
```bash
# Navigate to frappe_docker directory
cd /Users/adeemadilkhatri/adnoor-erp/frappe_docker

# Restore the backup
docker compose exec backend bench --site adnoor-dev.local restore /path/to/backup.tar.gz

# Migrate to apply any necessary patches
docker compose exec backend bench --site adnoor-dev.local migrate
```

### Verification Steps
